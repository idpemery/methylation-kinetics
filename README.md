# methylation-kinetics

This repository contains the scripts to analyze data as described in "Probing multiple enzymatic methylatin events in real time with NMR spectroscopy" by ET Usher, et al. Biophys J (2021).

My apologies for the number of different languages used here. 

Sample data is provided for the global fitting of kinetic data in matlab.
